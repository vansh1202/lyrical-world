          I was listening to the ocean <br>
          I saw a face in the sand <br>
          But when I picked it up <br>
          Then it vanished away from my hands, down <br>
          I had a dream I was seven <br>
          Climbing my way in a tree <br>
          I saw a piece of heaven <br>
          Waiting, impatient, for me, down <br> <br>
          
          And I was running far away <br>
          Would I run off the world someday? <br>
          Nobody knows, nobody knows <br>
          And I was dancing in the rain <br>
          I felt alive and I can't complain <br>
          But now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I can't take it anymore <br> <br>
          
          I was painting a picture <br>
          The picture was a painting of you <br>
          And for a moment I thought you were here <br>
          But then again, it wasn't true, down <br>
          And all this time I have been lying <br>
          Oh, lying in secret to myself <br>
          I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf <br> <br>
          
          La di da! <br> <br>
          
          And I was running far away <br>
          Would I run off the world someday? <br>
          Nobody knows, nobody knows <br>
          And I was dancing in the rain <br>
          I felt alive and I can't complain <br>
          But now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I got no other place to go <br>
          Now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I got no other place to go <br>
          Now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I can't take it anymore <br>
          <br>
          But I kept running for a soft place to fall <br>
          And I kept running for a soft place to fall <br>
          And I kept running for a soft place to fall <br>
          And I kept running for a soft place to fall <br>
          <br>
          And I was running far away <br>
          Would I run off the world someday? <br>
          But now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I got no other place to go <br>
          Now take me home <br>
          Take me home where I belong <br>
          I got no other place to go <br> <br>
          
          Now take me home, home where I belong <br>
          Now take me home, home where I belong <br>
          Now take me home, home where I belong <br>
          Now take me home, home where I belong <br> <br>
          
          I can't take it anymore <br>
