You say you love me, I say you crazy<br>
We're nothing more than friends<br>
You're not my lover, more like a brother<br>
I know you since we were like ten<br>
<br>
Don't mess it up, talking that shit<br>
Only gonna push me away, that's it<br>
When you say you love me, that make me crazy<br>
Here we go again<br><br>

Don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
You really ain't going away without a fight<br>
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite<br>
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times<br><br>

Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
Haven't I made it clear?<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
Haven't I made it clear?<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br><br>

Have you got no shame? You looking insane<br>
Turning up at my door<br>
It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring<br>
Haven't we been here before?<br><br>

Don't mess it up, talking that shit<br>
Only gonna push me away, that's it<br>
Have you got no shame? You looking insane<br>
Here we go again<br><br>

So don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
You really ain't going away without a fight<br>
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite<br>
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times<br><br>

Haven't I made it obvious? (Haven't I made it?)<br>
Haven't I made it clear? (Haven't I made it clear?)<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
Haven't I made it clear? (I swear I have!)<br>
Want me to spell it out for you? (Want me to spell it out for you?)<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br><br>

F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
That's how you fucking spell "friends"<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
Get that shit inside your head<br>
No, no, yeah, uh, ah<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
We're just friends<br><br>

So don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
You really ain't going away without a fight<br>
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite<br>
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times<br><br>

Haven't I made it obvious? (Haven't I made it obvious?)<br>
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)<br>
Want me to spell it out for you? (yeah)<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S (I said F-R-I-E-N-D-S)<br>
Haven't I made it obvious? (I made it very obvious)<br>
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
