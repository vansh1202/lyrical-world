          They say oh my God I see the way you shine<br>
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine<br>
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by<br>
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br>
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
And oh my I, I, I like your style<br>
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br><br>
So they say<br>
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br>
I said oh my God I see you walking by<br>
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes<br>
Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life<br>
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time<br>
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
And oh my I, I like your style<br>
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br><br>
So they say<br>
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
They say<br>
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
Ooh<br>
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh<br>
Ooh<br>
Ah ah, ah<br><br>
They say<br>
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br>
<br>They say<br>
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br>
All again<br>
